Explanation

Purpose

The `swapExactTokensForTokens` function in UniswapV2Router02 contract facilitates the exchange of an exact amount of input tokens for a minimum amount of output tokens. It ensures liquidity providers and traders can swap tokens efficiently while maintaining the specified constraints.

Detailed Usage
- The function first calculates the expected output amounts using the `getAmountsOut` function from `UniswapV2Library`, which involves price calculations based on the input amount and the token pair path provided.
- It then checks that the final output amount is greater than or equal to the minimum amount specified (`amountOutMin`). If not, the transaction reverts, protecting users from unfavorable slippage.
- The `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` function is called to transfer the input tokens from the user to the first Uniswap pair in the path.
- Finally, the `_swap` function is called to perform the actual token swap across the pairs. The `call` method is utilized within the `_swap` function to invoke the `swap` function on each pair contract.

Impact
The `swapExactTokensForTokens` function is crucial for enabling token swaps on Uniswap, a core feature of the protocol. By ensuring that the actual output meets the user's minimum requirement, it provides security against price slippage. The use of `call` within the `_swap` function allows for direct interaction with the pair contracts, ensuring efficient execution of token swaps across multiple pairs in the provided path. This method is essential for maintaining the decentralized and trustless nature of the Uniswap protocol.
